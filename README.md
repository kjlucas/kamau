## About Me
***
Hello! I am a 3rd year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science at Washington University in St.Louis (WashU), Kamau Lucas.\
I am a motivated, self-starter with a background in computer science. If your company relies on its employees having passion and energy, that’s exactly what I bring to the table. I am a hard worker, a team player, and a quick learner. I crave knowledge and I am eager for new and challenging experiences. Internships shouldn’t be a one-way street. With me, you’ll get a major return on your investment in both productivity and innovation.
